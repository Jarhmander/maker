=====

Modular Makefile.

- Common variables (SRC, LDFLAGS, CFLAGS etc) are files. It allows to rebuild what's necessary by
  making explicit dependencies to those files (changing CFLAGS requires complete rebuild, changing
  LDFLAGS only require relinking, changing SRC may require compiling new files and then relink,
  etc)
- Simply add your custom rules as files, never edit 'core' ones. Variables can be added as files.

TODO
----

- Control verbosity
- Different filesystem organization
- Allow specifying subprojects (ala boilermake)
- Allow explicit per-file variable override (ex: different CFLAGS for some files)
- Better support for archive files (can be done manually, but it's better to support them directly)

Status
------

By providing a SRC file in make/vars, it can build an executable project. With the rights LDFLAGS,
it can make shared objects files too. (No direct archive file support). It warns about files it
doesn't know what to do with.
