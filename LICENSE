Instead of pasting here lawyer non-sense, I made those simple, easy to read guidelines:
- You can use and modify freely without any restrictions.
- Use at your own risk; do not sue me if it breaks or hurts/kills people (rather unlikely, though), it's your fault.
- If you make modifications, credits are appreciated. Contributing (via e.g. pull requests) is even more appreciated.
- Do good. Don't be evil.
